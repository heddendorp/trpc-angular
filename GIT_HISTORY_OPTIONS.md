# Git History Management Options

## Current Status

The repository currently has a minimal git history with only 2-3 commits:
- Initial setup
- VSCode directory removal
- Migration to Yarn 4 and @trpc references removal

## Git History Cleanup Options

### Option 1: Keep Current History (Recommended)

**Pros:**
- Preserves development history
- Maintains git blame information
- No disruption to existing clones/forks

**Cons:**
- Retains any connection to original repository

**Action:** No action required - current history is already minimal

### Option 2: Create Fresh Repository

**Pros:**
- Complete clean slate
- No connection to original repository
- Fresh start for independent development

**Cons:**
- Breaks existing clones/forks
- Loses all git history
- Requires re-cloning for all developers

**Steps:**
1. Create new repository on GitHub
2. Move existing files to new repo
3. Update remote URLs
4. Archive old repository

### Option 3: Git History Wipe (Orphan Branch)

**Pros:**
- Keeps same repository
- Creates fresh history
- Maintains repository settings

**Cons:**
- Breaks existing clones
- Requires force push
- May cause confusion

**Steps:**
```bash
# Create orphan branch
git checkout --orphan fresh-start

# Add all files
git add -A

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit - Angular tRPC packages"

# Delete old main branch
git branch -D main

# Rename current branch to main
git branch -m main

# Force push to remote
git push -f origin main
```

### Option 4: Squash History

**Pros:**
- Maintains single commit history
- Preserves repository continuity
- Less disruptive than full wipe

**Cons:**
- Still connected to original repository
- Loses detailed development history

**Steps:**
```bash
# Interactive rebase to squash all commits
git rebase -i --root

# In editor, change 'pick' to 'squash' for all but first commit
# Save and exit

# Force push
git push -f origin main
```

## Recommendation

**Keep the current minimal history (Option 1)** because:

1. The repository already has very minimal history
2. The commits are clean and relevant
3. No disruption to development workflow
4. History shows the migration process clearly

## If You Choose to Reset History

If you decide to proceed with a fresh start, use **Option 3 (Orphan Branch)** as it's the cleanest approach:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Git history reset script

# Backup current state
git tag pre-reset-backup

# Create orphan branch
git checkout --orphan fresh-start

# Add all current files
git add -A

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit

- @heddendorp/angular-http-client v0.0.1 - Angular HttpClient integration for tRPC
- @heddendorp/tanstack-angular-query v0.0.1 - TanStack Angular Query integration for tRPC
- Yarn 4.3.1 workspace configuration
- TypeScript build system with tsdown
- Lerna publishing configuration
- Comprehensive documentation and maintenance guide"

# Delete old main branch
git branch -D main

# Rename current branch to main
git branch -m main

# Force push to remote (WARNING: This will rewrite history)
git push -f origin main

# Clean up backup tag if everything looks good
# git tag -d pre-reset-backup
```

## Post-Reset Actions

If you reset the history, notify all contributors:

1. **Send notification** to all developers
2. **Archive old clones** - all existing clones will be broken
3. **Fresh clone required** for all developers:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/heddendorp/trpc.git
   ```
4. **Update CI/CD** if it depends on specific commit hashes
5. **Update documentation** that references specific commits

## Security Considerations

- History reset cannot be undone once others have pulled
- Consider if any sensitive information was in previous commits
- Current repository appears clean - no sensitive data visible

## Final Recommendation

**Don't reset the history** - the current state is already clean and minimal. The effort and potential disruption outweigh the benefits of a fresh start.
